        AboutUs: "StoryTime was started with the goal of bringing the family back together. Today, everyone works longer hours which include nights and weekends. Many parents are required to travel and cannot be home to spend time with their children. For a child, nothing compares to the familiar face and voice of their parents, especially while spending time apart. All too often, parents are too focused on what they have to do next and forget to take the time to bond with their family. We have given you this time! Our READwithME® option allows families to come together and enjoy the precious moments before their children grow up. Now you can take a 5-10 minute break from your busy day wherever you are (office, airport, hotel) to read a story with your child and say I love you!",

        Folds: "We are proud to have partnered with Folds of Honor because we believe in helping those who have given the ultimate sacrifice to ensure our freedom. Folds of Honor provides millions of dollars worth of scholarships to military families. StoryTime will donate a portion of each subscription to Folds of Honor to support our common goal of helping the lives of veterans and their families. Your subscription will not only help your child and family, but also a military family in need.",
